1. To access Nexus:

   NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the ingress load balancer to become available or the backends to become HEALTHY.
         You can watch the status of the backends by running:
         `kubectl get ingress -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.annotations.ingress\.kubernetes\.io/backends}'`
